BMC Network --- A decentralized peer-to-peer messagging, mircoblogging and broadcasting system.

Introducing Broadcast Message Coin (BMC) and Its Functions:

BMC may have some of the following functions on the Broadcast Message Network:

1. Incentives for BM Network node-runners.

2. Fuel to perform some special functions on the network. For example performing a super broadcasting on the whole network to reach millions of audience.

3. To pay/tip/subscribe bloggers’ exclusive contents.

4. To purchase special limited avatars, collectable items and other digital assets.


Other cool functions are also open for proposal.

The bottom line is that we should make it super simple to understand and friendly to use.
